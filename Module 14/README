# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview
The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is an interactive web application that visualizes the bacterial data for each volunteer.

## Features
- A dropdown menu for selecting individual test subject IDs
- A bar chart displaying the top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual
- A bubble chart that visualizes the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in the selected individual
- A demographic information panel that displays metadata about the test subject


## Technologies Used
- D3.js for data manipulation and binding DOM elements to data
- Plotly.js for interactive charts
- Bootstrap for styling and layout
- HTML/CSS for webpage structure and design
